<h1 style="margin-top: 0;">Hi, I'm James Little!</h1>

<p>I'm a software engineer and design enthusiast from Boston, Massachusetts.</p>

<p>
    <strong>I'm interested in how people interact with technology. I want to make the digital world simple, intuitive, and a touch playful with the software I create.</strong>
</p>

<hr />

<p>I work at
    <a href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</a>. Right now, I'm on the Docs team.
    Previously, I've helped build <a href="https://stripe.com/terminal">Terminal</a> and the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/stripe-dashboard/id978516833">Stripe Dashboard iOS app</a>.</p>

<p>I started at Stripe after graduating from
    <a href="https://bowdoin.edu">Bowdoin College</a>
    in Brunswick, Maine, where I majored in Computer Science, built a website for the
    <a href="https://bowdoinorient.com">student newspaper</a>, and
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7XT98HchBs">made robots play soccer</a>.</p>
