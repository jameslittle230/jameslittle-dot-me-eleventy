<h1 style="margin-top: 0">Hi, I'm James Little!</h1>

<p>I'm a software engineer and design enthusiast from Boston, currently living in San Francisco, Calif.</p>

<p>I'm currently working at
    <a href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</a>, building in-person payment experiences on the
    <a href="https://stripe.com/terminal">Terminal</a>
    team.</p>

<p>I started at Stripe after graduating from
    <a href="https://bowdoin.edu">Bowdoin College</a>
    in Brunswick, Maine, where I majored in Computer Science, worked as the Digital Director for the
    <a href="https://bowdoinorient.com">student newspaper</a>, and
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7XT98HchBs">played with robots</a>.</p>

<p>
    <strong>I'm interested in how people interact with technology, and I want to make interfacing with the digital world simpler and more intuitive through the software I create.</strong>
